# Mutex

ðŸš¦ [Mutual exclusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_exclusion) abstractions for PHP's [Swoole](https://www.swoole.co.uk/) concurrency run-time.

[Swoole](https://www.swoole.co.uk/) awesomeness enables concurrency across multiple processes and cores, but sharing state/memory between them isn't a straightforward achievement. [`Swoole\Table`](https://www.swoole.co.uk/docs/modules/swoole-table) comes to help, but maybe we could have an even better API for that task.

**This package is a [Facade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern) for [`Swoole\Table`](https://www.swoole.co.uk/docs/modules/swoole-table) providing common APIs for mutual exclusion patterns.**

_And we all hail [**Edsger W. Dijkstra**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra)._
